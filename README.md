## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a Project exercise. We will build a small server that can provide some basic Banking Services using **Spring Boot** and **Kotlin**. The goal is to build a RESTful server that allows users to perform basic banking operations.

This exercise will help you practice:
* Creating Spring Boot projects from scratch.
* Designing and implementing REST APIs, clearly specifying endpoints (HTTP methods, request bodies, response structures).
* Handling validation and error scenarios, such as insufficient balance during transfers or duplicate usernames.
* Managing basic CRUD operations and business logic.
* Implementing transaction history to allow users to view past deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

## üìå Project Guidelines

* **Individual project**: Each student submits their own repository.
* **Start from scratch** using Spring Initializr.
* **Collaboration**: You can discuss concepts and share notes, but all code must be written independently.
* **Integrity**: Do not copy-paste others' code or use AI-generated code that you do not fully understand.

## üìä Database Structure (ERD)

* This is an example ERD. Feel Free to create your own to match your back-end.
   * Some tools to help you:

## üéØ User Stories (Requirements)

Your banking server must implement the following features:

1. As a User, I can register my username & password
2. As a User, I can create multiple accounts
3. As a User, I can put my KYC information in a profile
4. As a User, I can close my account
5. As a User, I can transfer money to another account

## ‚úÖ Submission Checklist

* Functional API endpoints meeting all the user stories.
* Database schema matching the provided ERD.
* Well-organized, readable Kotlin code.
* Repository link submitted by the deadline.
* Follow Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository pattern

## üéâ **Happy Coding! Remember, the goal is to learn, experiment, and build confidence with Spring Boot and Kotlin. Ask questions and enjoy the journey!**
